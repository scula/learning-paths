      # Learning Objectives

      In this lesson, we will learn more about a new (but actually oldschool ðŸŽ¸) way to interact with the computer
      through the terminal. These are the necessary skills for anyone who wants to learn Python and programming 
      in general:

      1. **Running Python Scripts from the Terminal:** Our code doesn't live in a vacuum, it works 
      with other programs, files and operating system. We need to understand the environment in which our
      program is running. 

      2. **Navigating and Managing Files and Directories:** This is a fundamental skill for any programmer and
      again relates to the environment we are in. Our program and (and we) need to be aware of our surroundings 
      (files and directories).

      3. **Basic Knowledge of the Operating System:** We'll cover just the basics of the operating system (OS), like
      how programs and files interact with each other and how OS manages all of that.


      This lesson will be a bit theory-heavy but in the end you will have a chance to practice in the Codelab.

      # What is a terminal?

      We are used to interacting with the computer through the graphical user interface or **GUI**. We launch 
      programs just by clicking on icons, navigate through files and directories by clicking on them, and
      we can see the data in them by opening them with the appropriate program. For example, to view the contents 
      of the folder, we can open it with some built-in file manager (doesn't matter what OS you are using,
      you can definitely recognise what happens here):

      But there is another way to interact with the computer, even more powerful ðŸ”‹ and flexible. Surprisingly,
      it's done with a simple text. You type in a command, and the computer executes it. And the **terminal** is
      just a program through which we can access the super mode:

    card_group: "what_is_terminal"
    value: |
      It looks different on different operating systems but the idea is always the same. Usually we see the 
      **prompt** (symbol that indicates that the terminal is ready to accept the command, in our example 
      it's the dollar sign `$`) and the **cursor** (symbol that indicates where the next character will 
      appear, in our example it's a white rectangle).

    card_group: "rules"

      # Two simple rules of working with the terminal

      **First**, in terminal you are *always in some directory*. It's not like in the GUI where you can just open
      multiple windows and switch between them. In the terminal you are always in some directory and to change
      it you will need to use the command. 

      So here:

    card_group: "rules"
    value: |
      we are actually in the same directory as in the GUI, but we can't see the contents of the directory 
      or the name of the directory. To see it we can use the **second rule** - we invoke programs by typing 
      their name and pressing **Enter**. 

      Let's look around and check in what directory we are in. We will use `pwd` command which stands for
      **print working directory**:

    hero_image: https://storage.googleapis.com/scula-public-assets/courses/python/command_line_shell/terminal_folder_pwd.png
    card_group: "rules"
    value: |
      We can see a new text below our command, it's called the **output**. In our case, it's:
      ```
      /Users/nzavyalov/dev/temp/our_folder
      ```
      Which is the path to the current directory. Path represents the hierarchy of directories and files.
      Everything starts from the toop `/` directory, which is called the **root** directory. And then we
      have directories and files inside of it. And `our_folder` is actually nested several levels deep in 
      the hierarchy.

      # Commands and Programs 

      Now that we know the basics, let's check what's inside our directory. We can use the `ls` command which
      stands for **list**. It will list all the files and directories in the current directory:

    card_group: "commands_programs"
    value: |
      Which is the same as in the GUI. But what if we want to see the contents of the file? We can use the `cat`
      command which stands for **concatenate** but is usually used to print the contents of the file to the terminal:
  - type: "paragraph"
    hero_image: https://storage.googleapis.com/scula-public-assets/courses/python/command_line_shell/terminal_text_file_cat.png
    card_group: "commands_programs"
    value: |
      And we can see the contents of the file. But this time we didn't type only the name of the program, we also
      added the name of the file. And that's because `cat` is a program that accepts arguments. And the arguments
      are just additional information that we pass to the program. In our case, we passed the name of the file
      to the `cat` program. Spoiler: same will happen when we will try to launch our Python program.

      # Creating Python program through the terminal

      Now let's create a new file called `main.py` with a simple Python program.
      We will use `echo` command which just prints the text to the terminal. And we will use `>>` symbol to redirect
      the output of the `echo` command to the file which will be automatically created.
      ```
      $ echo "print('Hey')" >> main.py
      ```

    card_group: "python_launch"
    value: |
      And we can also used the previously learned commands to check that the file was created and to see its contents:

    hero_image: https://storage.googleapis.com/scula-public-assets/courses/python/command_line_shell/terminal_echo_check.png
    card_group: "python_launch"
    value: |
      Now let's try to run our program. We will use the `python` command which is the Python interpreter. It will
      execute the Python code that we pass to it. And we will pass the name of our file to the `python` command:
  - type: "paragraph"
    hero_image: https://storage.googleapis.com/scula-public-assets/courses/python/command_line_shell/terminal_py_launch.png
    card_group: "python_launch"
    value: |
      And we can see that our program was executed and the output was printed to the terminal.

      # Summary and codelab

      That was a lot! Believe us we were also overwhelmed when we first saw the terminal. But don't worry,
      we will practice all of that in the Codelab. But before that, let's summarise what we've learned so far.

      * The terminal is a program that allows us to interact with the computer in a text-based way.
      * We can run programs by typing their name and pressing **Enter**.
      * We can pass arguments to the programs.
      * We can do everything we can do in the GUI but without touching the mouse.
      * We can launch Python programs from the terminal using the `python` command.

      Bonus: Terminal is actually just a program that allows us to interact with the shell which is another 
      program ðŸª† that does the actual communication with the operating system. There are many different shells,
      but we will use **bash** because it's one of the most popular shells and the default shell on most Linux
      distributions, Mac OS and can be installed on Windows too.
