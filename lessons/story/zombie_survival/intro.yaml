      # The Beginning of the Story
      It has been seven days since my familiar world ended. What began as an outbreak of a new epidemic 
      quickly escalated into a full-blown zombie apocalypse. Contrary to popular culture's portrayal, 
      the reality was harsh and merciless. My name is Ada, and I find myself alone in a temporary Airbnb 
      in deserted New York. I arrived here two weeks ago to apply to Art School. Fortunately, I was in 
      my apartment when the chaos erupted. Government services and the media were too slow to respond, 
      and the streets soon turned into a haven for ravenous monsters. 
      On a positive note, the zombies seemed to fear sunlight and were active only underground or at night. 
      However, my dwindling food supply (now completely exhausted) forced me to devise a plan to 
      leave the city in search of a safer refuge.

      ## A New Home
      I departed at dawn, aiming to cycle to my aunt's house in the suburbs. 
      She resided on the outskirts of a small countryside town, an ideal spot for concealment. 
      After eight grueling hours of continuous pedaling, I was gasping for breath. 
      Even before the house came into view, I sensed something amiss. Smoke was rising from the 
      ground as if recently extinguished, and scraps of metal lay scattered about. 
      The house was nowhere in sight, and it dawned on me that the military had bombed the suburbs 
      last week in a desperate attempt to contain the outbreak. 
      With roughly two hours before nightfall, which would unleash the monsters, my options were limited.

      I took a route through abandoned warehouses towards the next small village. Eventually, 
      I stumbled upon one that was intact, with a faded sign reading "Tech..y." 
      Since phones were as useful as bricks without electricity, I decided to search inside for batteries or accumulators.
      My expectations were low as I peered inside, but what I found left me astounded. Layers of thick dust 
      covered aisles of canned food, old computers, and numerous boxes of various tech items. 
      It appeared that no human or zombie had set foot in this place for years.
      Lacking better options at the moment, I decided this could serve as a temporary base 
      for my forthcoming endeavors.

      ## A Glimmer of Hope
      Amidst the layers of dust and the hushed silence of the abandoned warehouse, I stumbled upon an old, 
      yet seemingly intact computer. With a mix of curiosity and desperation, I pressed the power button, 
      half-expecting nothing to happen. To my surprise, the machine hummed to life, its screen flickering as 
      it booted up. The desktop, cluttered with files and folders, had an icon for Python prominently 
      displayed, hinting at its previous user's interests. 


      Beside the keyboard, partially covered in dust, lay a well-used book titled "Python Programming: A 
      Comprehensive Guide". The sight of it sparked a flicker of hope within me. Perhaps, within these 
      digital and paper pages, I could find valuable knowledge or tools to aid in my survival in 
      this new, chaotic world.

      After briefly skimming through the book, I tried to run one simple program to cheer me up:

      print("Cheer up, Ada! ☀️")

      Well, that was easy! I wonder what else I can do with this Python thing...
