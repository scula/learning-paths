      # A Day of Challenges and Learning
      On the third day, Ada faced new challenges. She noticed that the power supply to the warehouse was fluctuating. Concerned, she decided to write a Python script that would monitor the power levels and alert her if they dropped too low. She used a `for` loop to iterate through a list of power readings and an `if-else` statement to check each reading. If a reading was below a certain threshold, the script would trigger an alarm.

  - type: "codeblock-exec"
    value: |
      power_readings = [80, 90, 75, 60, 85, 50]
      threshold = 70

      def check_power(readings, limit):
          for reading in readings:
              if reading < limit:
                  return "Power low! Alarm triggered."
          return "Power stable."

      alarm_status = check_power(power_readings, threshold)
      print(alarm_status)

      # Securing Resources
      With the power situation under control, Ada's next task was to secure her food and water supplies. She decided to use Python to sort and categorize her supplies. Implementing a `for` loop, she sorted items into `food` and `water` lists based on their type. Then, using `if-else` statements, she determined which items were nearing their expiration date and should be consumed first.

  - type: "codeblock-exec"
    value: |
      supplies = [("beans", "food"), ("water bottle", "water"), ("canned fruit", "food"), ("water jug", "water")]
      food = []
      water = []

      for item, type in supplies:
          if type == "food":
              food.append(item)
          else:
              water.append(item)

      print("Food:", food)
      print("Water:", water)

      # Unexpected Visitors
      As night fell, Ada detected movement outside through her `monitorAreas` function. She observed a group of survivors trying to enter the warehouse. Using her Python skills, she quickly wrote a script to selectively open doors for the survivors while keeping the zombies out. This script used a combination of `for` loops and `if-else` statements to control each door based on camera inputs.

  - type: "codeblock-exec"
    value: |
      doors = ["front", "back", "side"]
      camera_inputs = {"front": "survivors", "back": "clear", "side": "zombies"}

      def control_doors(door_list, inputs):
          commands = {}
          for door in door_list:
              if inputs[door] == "survivors":
                  commands[door] = "open"
              elif inputs[door] == "clear":
                  commands[door] = "lock"
              else:
                  commands[door] = "close"
          return commands

      door_commands = control_doors(doors, camera_inputs)
      print(door_commands)
