      # Welcome to the first Sprint of our Python Course
      Congratulations on taking the first steps in your computer science journey! 
      Whether you want to start a new career and become a programmer or add a skill to your toolbelt for parsing data like a pro, 
      we've got you covered with our Python Introduction Course. We will have a great month together where we will get our hands 
      dirty with challenging projects, learn about new ideas and engage with a fantastic community of like-minded peers.

      ## What awaits us in the course?
      This course is intended for absolute beginners in programming or computer science but is not limited to them. 
      Thanks to our adaptable roadmap, you can customise your learning journey by exploring sibling lessons that 
      provide more information on complex concepts or uncover the subject's inner workings. We will focus on learning syntax, 
      basic operations, functions and data types in Python and touch on how programming language interacts with an 
      operating system (by reading and writing files). We will explore concepts like Object Oriented Programming and 
      learn about essential developer tools and platforms like Vscode, GitHub and Git.

      The goal is to give you a good starting ground for learning new skills and challenges. It could be Data Science,
       Backend Development, System Administration, DevOps or even Desktop App development. 
       The beauty of Python is its simplicity and versatility because it's used in many areas of the Computer Science industry.

      ## How will we learn?
      Our learning journey will last for 1 month and have 2 Sprints. 
      Each Sprint will be 2 weeks long and have a Project at the end of it. 
      The Project at the end of the second Sprint will be reviewed by an actual software engineer. 
      The process will be similar to how it goes in the best tech companies; 
      that is how all software engineers learn and improve their craft. 

      As for the lessons, they are already available in your roadmap for this course. You will notice that sometimes more 
      than one lesson is open. That is because you can choose what and when to learn! There is still some order due to 
      dependency on previous knowledge, but within those parallel lessons, you can go in any order.

      We will also have our cosy Slack-based community where you can ask questions and communicate with your peers in 
      the course. We will have a dedicated space for asking technical questions where other students or reviewers will
       help you. You can also chat with your dedicated Coordinator, who will guide your group through this month and 
       help you remember all the important dates. If you have any questions about payments or exceptional cases, 
       Coordinator takes care of this.

      ## First steps: First Sprint

      In the first Sprint, we will focus on learning the core of Python: syntax and basic operations. Nevertheless, 
      we will still do our first Project, where you will practice all the theories from the past two weeks. 

      Please get familiar with the platform and our Slack community. The Coordinator will kickstart the process, 
      but there is a first task for you:
      Open the Slack app and introduce yourself in the channel #community

      ## Road ahead

      Once again, kudos to you for embarking on this learning journey! We know firsthand how challenging education 
      can be, but we come prepared. Roadmap will help you visualise and track your progress. Our lessons are designed 
      to harden your knowledge with numerous practices. Feedback from software engineers will give you real-world experience. 
      And our community in Slack is always ready to help you.

      Good luck, and see you in the next lesson! ðŸ¤©
