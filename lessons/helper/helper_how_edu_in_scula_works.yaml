      # Schedule and lesson structure

      ## Schedule and Sprints

      Our program officially kicks off on January 29th and will run until February 25th.
      Designed with flexibility in mind, it includes **two dynamic Sprints**, each lasting two weeks. 
      At the end of each Sprint, you'll have the chance to apply your newfound knowledge to a 
      practical **project assignment**.


      While there's no rigid timetable, we suggest dedicating the first week of each Sprint to 
      absorbing the theory, leaving the second week to dive deep into your project work. 
      This is, however, just a guideline – you have complete freedom to tailor your learning 
      experience. Whether you're someone who can power through the lessons in a single day or 
      prefer to pace yourself with smaller, daily learning sessions, it's all up to you. 
      Our priority is to accommodate your unique learning style and life commitments.


      Remember, there's no single 'correct' way to learn. We believe in supporting your 
      individual journey as you explore the basics of Python, ensuring you feel at ease and 
      confident every step of the way.

      ## Theory and practice

      Our program is a fully online, text-based learning adventure, designed to make 
      coding both fun and accessible. Each lesson is carefully crafted with 
      a theoretical segment that introduces you to key concepts and definitions, 
      paired with interactive, hands-on sections where you can put those ideas into practice.


      Let's explore the different ways you can interact with code in our program:

      ### Code Snippet 

      Embedded right within the lesson, these snippets allow you to see the code 
      and copy it to your workspace. It will look like this:
      ```
      print("I am a code snippet")
      ```
  - type: "paragraph"
    card_group: "code_demo"
    value: |
      ### CodeDemo 

      This is where things get even more exciting. Embedded in the lesson, 
      these demos are fully interactive. You can run the code, spot errors, 
      and tweak it to see how changes affect the output. It's a brilliant tool for
      experimenting and learning from trial and error.

      ### Codelab
      Step into our virtual workspace. Part of the Scula platform, Codelab is where 
      you can take on more complex tasks and projects. Here, you're not just learning; 
      you're doing. More details on this in just a bit.

  - type: "paragraph"
    value: |
      ### Project

      At the end of each Sprint, you'll face the ultimate challenge: a **Project**. 
      Think of it as the 'boss level' in a video game. You'll need to apply everything you've 
      learned to conquer it. These projects are your opportunity to build real services that 
      actual people might use. And the best part? A professional software engineer reviews every 
      line of your code, ensuring it's not just functional but also adheres to industry standards.


      In summary, our program is more than just learning; it's about applying, experimenting,
      and truly understanding how code comes to life. We're here to guide you through
      each step, ensuring you have the tools and support to tackle each challenge 
      and emerge as a confident coder.

    value: |
      ### VSCode IDE: Terminal Launch
      Terminal is a program that runs on your computer and allows you to interact with the operating
      system. The VSCode IDE that you see in the **Codelab** is running on a virtual machine as a usual
      program. But you can't hide it or close it to see the desktop because there is actually no 
      graphical interface for that virtual machine. But you can still interact with it through the
      **Terminal**.

      To open it click on 3 parallel lines icon on the top left corner of the VSCode IDE and select
      **Terminal** -> **New Terminal**. This will open a new **Terminal** panel at the bottom of the
      VSCode IDE.

      ### Running commands in the Terminal
      Now you can run commands in the **Terminal**. What does `to run a command` or `execute a command` mean?

      It means you can interact with the Operating System through the **Terminal**. You can run programs,
      install programs, create files, delete files, move files around, and do all of that without ever
      touching the mouse. To run a command you just type it in the **Terminal** and press `Enter`.

      You will always see the result of the command in the **Terminal** whether it was successful or not.

      ## How we communicate in Slack

      Navigating the nuances of online communication can be challenging. Without the benefit of 
      face-to-face interactions, it's easy for messages to be misunderstood or misinterpreted. 
      To foster clear and effective communication within our digital space, we recommend adhering 
      to the following guidelines:
      1. Use Channels Appropriately: Respect the purpose of each Slack channel. Post your 
      messages in the relevant channels to keep the conversations organized and on-topic.
      2. Be Clear and Concise: Time is valuable. Write clearly and concisely. Avoid long paragraphs. 
      Bullet points can be effective for listing ideas or questions.
      3. Start Threads for Specific Discussions: To keep conversations focused and easy to follow, 
      start a thread when replying to a specific point. This helps contain discussions within 
      their relevant context.
      4. Use Mentions Sparingly: Tag specific people (@name) only when their attention is needed. 
      Overusing mentions can lead to notification fatigue.
      5. Share Files Thoughtfully: When sharing files or documents, provide a brief description of 
      the content to help your colleagues understand the context.
      6. Respect Work-Life Balance: Be mindful of sending messages during off-hours. Consider 
      scheduling messages to be sent during work hours if it's not urgent.
      7. Proofread Before Sending: Typos and grammatical errors can lead to misunderstandings. 
      A quick proofread can ensure clarity in your communication.
      8. Acknowledge Messages: If a message requires a more detailed response, or if you need 
      time to gather information, acknowledge receipt and give a timeframe for your reply.
      9. Use Emojis and Reactions Appropriately: Emojis and reactions can add tone and clarity 
      to your messages but use them appropriately, keeping in mind the professional environment.
      10. Stay Inclusive and Professional: Always communicate with respect and inclusivity. 
      Avoid language or topics that could be deemed inappropriate or offensive.


      By adhering to these guidelines, you can contribute to a more efficient, respectful, 
      and productive Slack environment.
