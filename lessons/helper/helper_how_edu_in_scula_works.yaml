      # Learning with Scula

      Learning with Scula is quite straightforward. We have our platform where you can learn,
      practice theory and work on your projects. We also use a couple of external tools to
      communicate and work together.

      # Schedule and Curriculum

      You can find the curriculum (or topics that we'll cover) on the main page of the course. 
      There you can also notice that the educational process is time-boxed in **Sprints**.

      ## Sprints

      Each **Sprint** is 2 weeks long and has a set of lessons and a project that you should complete. 
      There is no strict schedule but we recommend to finish the theory during the first week and
      focus on the project during the second week.

      ## Theory and lessons 

      Each lesson has a theory part and interactive practical parts. Some practical tasks are 
      embedded inside the lesson, some will require working with **Codelab** â€” a part of Scula
      platform where you will have a virtual workspace to work on more complex tasks and projects. 

      ## Projects

      Each **Sprint** has a **Project** that you should complete. You can select one of the suggested projects
      and work on it together with a mentor.

      # Codelab

      **Codelab** is a virtual workspace inside the Scula platform for you to work independently from 
      your own device. Each time you will open a new **Codelab** workspace it will be a fresh environment
      with all the necessary tools and libraries installed. 

      ## How to launch Codelab?

      Inside some of the lessons you will find a special card labeled **Codelab** which you will need to 
      complete in order to finish the lesson. When you click on the card you will be redirected to the
      **Codelab** workspace.

      ## How to use Codelab?

      **Codelab** consists of 2 parts:
      * Scula sidebar with tasks outline and help. There you can find the list of tasks that you need to complete
      and some additional information about the lesson. If you get stuck, use the hint button for each tasks.
      * VSCode IDE connected to the virtual machine. Think of it as a remote computer that you can access from 
      your browser. VSCode is the most popular IDE among developers and it has a lot of useful features.
      Working with it will give you a good understanding of how developers work.

      ## How to use VSCode inside Codelab?

      ### Overview

    value: |
      This is the overview of the **Codelab**. On the left you can see the tasks and on the right you can see the
      VSCode IDE.

      ### Files Explorer

    hero_image: https://storage.googleapis.com/scula-public-assets/courses/python/working_with_scula/explorer.png
    value: |
      Here you can see the **Explorer** panel. It shows the files and folders in the current working directory.
      You can create new files and folders here, rename them, move them around and delete them. Use the right 
      mouse button to open the context menu. 

      ### Editor

    value: |
      This is the **Editor** of the file. You can open it by clicking on the file in the **Explorer** panel.
      Here you can edit the content of the file. On top of the **Editor** panel  you can see the name of the opened 
      file and other opened files. You can switch between them by clicking on the tabs.

      ### Terminal Launch

    hero_image: https://storage.googleapis.com/scula-public-assets/courses/python/working_with_scula/terminal_launch.png
    value: |
      Terminal is a program that runs on your computer and allows you to interact with the operating
      system. The VSCode IDE that you see in the **Codelab** is running on a virtual machine as a usual
      program. But you can't hide it or close it to see the desktop because there is actually no 
      graphical interface for that virtual machine. But you can still interact with it through the
      **Terminal**.

      To open it click on 3 parallel lines icon on the top left corner of the VSCode IDE and select
      **Terminal** -> **New Terminal**. This will open a new **Terminal** panel at the bottom of the
      VSCode IDE.

      ### Running commands in the Terminal

    value: |
      Now you can run commands in the **Terminal**. What does `to run a command` or `execute a command` mean?

      It means you can interact with the Operating System through the **Terminal**. You can run programs,
      install programs, create files, delete files, move files around, and do all of that without ever
      touching the mouse. To run a command you just type it in the **Terminal** and press `Enter`.

      You will always see the result of the command in the **Terminal** whether it was successful or not.
