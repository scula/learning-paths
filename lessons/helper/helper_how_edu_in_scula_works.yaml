      ## Schedule and Sprints

      Our program officially kicks off on January 29th and will run until February 25th.
      Designed with flexibility in mind, it includes **two dynamic Sprints**, each lasting two weeks. 
      At the end of each Sprint, you'll have the chance to apply your newfound knowledge to a 
      practical **project assignment**.


      While there's no rigid timetable, we suggest dedicating the first week of each Sprint to 
      absorbing the theory, leaving the second week to dive deep into your project work. 
      This is, however, just a guideline – you have complete freedom to tailor your learning 
      experience. Whether you're someone who can power through the lessons in a single day or 
      prefer to pace yourself with smaller, daily learning sessions, it's all up to you. 
      Our priority is to accommodate your unique learning style and life commitments.


      Remember, there's no single 'correct' way to learn. We believe in supporting your 
      individual journey as you explore the basics of Python, ensuring you feel at ease and 
      confident every step of the way.

      you're doing. More details on this in just a bit.

  - type: "paragraph"
    value: |
      ### Project

      At the end of each Sprint, you'll face the ultimate challenge: a **Project**. 
      Think of it as the 'boss level' in a video game. You'll need to apply everything you've 
      learned to conquer it. These projects are your opportunity to build real services that 
      actual people might use. And the best part? A professional software engineer reviews every 
      line of your code, ensuring it's not just functional but also adheres to industry standards.


      In summary, our program is more than just learning; it's about applying, experimenting,
      and truly understanding how code comes to life. We're here to guide you through
      each step, ensuring you have the tools and support to tackle each challenge 
      and emerge as a confident coder.

    hero_image: https://storage.googleapis.com/scula-public-assets/courses/python/working_with_scula/vscode/4_vscode_terminal_launch.png
    value: |
      The **Terminal** is a vital tool that enables direct interaction with your computer's operating system.
      In the **Codelab**, the VSCode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you're using operates
      within a virtual machine, functioning like a standard application. 
      However, unlike typical applications, you can't minimize or close it to access a desktop 
      environment, as this virtual machine lacks a traditional graphical interface. 
      Nonetheless, you can engage with it effectively using the Terminal.


      To access the **Terminal** in VSCode, simply click on the icon with three horizontal lines 
      located at the top left corner of the IDE. Then, navigate to 'Terminal' and select 'New Terminal'. 
      This action will launch a new **Terminal** panel at the bottom of the VSCode interface, 
      allowing you to execute commands and manage tasks within the virtual machine environment.

    hero_image: https://storage.googleapis.com/scula-public-assets/courses/python/working_with_scula/vscode/5_vscode_terminal_cmd.png
    value: |
      Once the **Terminal** is open, you have the capability to execute various commands. 
      "Running" or "executing" a command refers to the process of issuing instructions to 
      the Operating System via the **Terminal**. This powerful tool allows you to perform a 
      wide range of tasks such as running programs, installing software, creating, 
      deleting, and moving files, all through keyboard inputs without the need for a mouse.

      To execute a command, simply type it into the **Terminal** and press **Enter**. The **Terminal** 
      provides immediate feedback, displaying the outcome of your command, whether it's 
      successful or encounters an error. This direct interaction with the Operating 
      System through typed commands is a highly efficient way to manage your computing tasks.

      ## How we communicate in Slack

      Navigating the nuances of online communication can be challenging. Without the benefit of 
      face-to-face interactions, it's easy for messages to be misunderstood or misinterpreted. 
      To foster clear and effective communication within our digital space, we recommend adhering 
      to the following guidelines:
      1. **Use Channels Appropriately**: Respect the purpose of each Slack channel. Post your 
      messages in the relevant channels to keep the conversations organized and on-topic.
      2. **Be Clear and Concise**: Time is valuable. Write clearly and concisely. Avoid long paragraphs. 
      Bullet points can be effective for listing ideas or questions.
      3. **Start Threads for Specific Discussions**: To keep conversations focused and easy to follow, 
      start a thread when replying to a specific point. This helps contain discussions within 
      their relevant context.
      4. **Use Mentions Sparingly**: Tag specific people (@name) only when their attention is needed. 
      Overusing mentions can lead to notification fatigue.
      5. **Share Files Thoughtfully**: When sharing files or documents, provide a brief description of 
      the content to help your colleagues understand the context.
      6. **Respect Work-Life Balance**: Be mindful of sending messages during off-hours. Consider 
      scheduling messages to be sent during work hours if it's not urgent.
      7. **Proofread Before Sending**: Typos and grammatical errors can lead to misunderstandings. 
      A quick proofread can ensure clarity in your communication.
      8. **Acknowledge Messages**: If a message requires a more detailed response, or if you need 
      time to gather information, acknowledge receipt and give a timeframe for your reply.
      9. **Use Emojis and Reactions Appropriately**: Emojis and reactions can add tone and clarity 
      to your messages but use them appropriately, keeping in mind the professional environment.
      10. **Stay Inclusive and Professional**: Always communicate with respect and inclusivity. 
      Avoid language or topics that could be deemed inappropriate or offensive.


      By adhering to these guidelines, you can contribute to a more efficient, respectful, 
      and productive Slack environment.
