      # Understanding Input and Output in Python

      Imagine you're having a conversation with a friend. You speak (output), they listen (input), 
      and then respond (output again). Similarly, in computing, there's always a flow of data. 
      Computers receive data (input) through various means like keyboards, files, or even the internet. 
      They process this data and then output it, maybe as a display on your screen, a file, or 
      sending it across the network.


      Now, let's narrow this down to Python. Understanding how data flows into and out of our Python 
      programs is crucial. It's like knowing how to have a conversation with your computer! We'll 
      explore how Python handles input (getting data into your program) and output (displaying results 
      or saving them), both interactively and through files. This lesson will make these concepts crystal 
      clear and get you comfortable with Python's input/output capabilities.

      Remember, input and output in computing are like a two-way conversation. 
      Your Python program 'listens' (input) and 'talks' (output).

      ## Input in Python

      In Python, getting data into your program can be as simple as asking the user for it. 
      This is called interactive input. For instance, the `input()` function allows your 
      program to pause and wait for user input.


      But what if you want to read lots of data, maybe from a file? Python makes it easy to 
      read from files too. This is especially useful for processing data in batch or 
      handling data that's too large to type in manually.

      Both these methods are essential tools in your Python toolkit. Let's see 
      how they work in practice.

      print(content)

      ## Output in Python

      Now, for the other side of the conversation: output. In Python, the most 
      common way to output data is using the `print()` function. It's straightforward and quite powerful. 
      But output isn't limited to the console. We can also write data to files, which is handy 
      for saving results, logging information, or sharing data with other programs.


      Both console and file output are essential for effective programming 
      in Python. Let's check out some examples.

      print(message)

    value: |
      with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
          file.write("Python makes file handling easy!")

    boilerplate: |
      filename = 'data.txt'
      content = # your code here
    task: "Read the contents of a file named `data.txt` and assign it to the variable `content`.\n"
    solution: |
      filename = 'data.txt'
      with open(filename, 'r') as file:
          content = file.read()
    test_code: |
      from main import content
      import unittest
      class TestFileReading(unittest.TestCase):
          def test_file_reading(self):
              with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
                  expected_content = file.read()
              self.assertEqual(content, expected_content, "Make sure that you read the file correctly.")
