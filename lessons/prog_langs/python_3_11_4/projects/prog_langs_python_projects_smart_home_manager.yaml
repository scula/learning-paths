      # Smart Home Controller

      ## Description

      This project involves the development of a Smart Home Controller application. The application will allow users to control various smart devices in their home, such as lights, thermostats, and security systems, through a user-friendly interface. The application will be designed using Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

      ## Technical Requirements

      General requirements:

      - The application should be developed in Python 3, utilizing OOP principles.
      - External libraries may be used for handling device communication or user interface elements.
      - The application should provide a command-line interface and optionally a graphical user interface.

      System requirements:

      - The application should use classes and objects to represent different smart devices.
      - Device classes should have methods for common actions like turning on/off, adjusting settings, etc.
      - The application should include a central controller class that manages interactions between different devices.
      - Use of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism should be demonstrated where appropriate.

      User Interface requirements:

      - The application should start with an interactive menu to choose different smart home devices to control.
      - Users should be able to perform actions like turning devices on/off, adjusting settings, and viewing device status.
      - The application should provide clear feedback on the results of user actions and any errors.

      Integration requirements:

      - The application should be able to interface with simulated smart devices (if actual devices are not available).
      - If external libraries are used for device communication, their integration should be seamless and well-documented.

      ## Game requirements:

      - The application should start with a welcome message and a brief explanation of its features.
      - Users should be guided through the process of selecting and interacting with different smart devices.
      - The application should handle invalid inputs gracefully and guide the user back to valid options.
      - Upon successful completion of an action, the application should display a confirmation message.
      - In case of errors or failures in device communication, the application should inform the user with an appropriate message.
